# **Bubble Sort Visualization**

A simple visualization of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm using **Pygame**. This project helps you understand how Bubble Sort works by animating the sorting process step by step.

## **What is Bubble Sort?**

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list (beginning of the array) with each pass.

### **How It Works**
1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare two adjacent elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat.
5. After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
6. Repeat until the array is fully sorted.

## **Features**
- Visualize comparisons, swaps, and the final sorted state.
- Interactive controls:
  - Press **R** to regenerate the array.
  - Use **Left/Right Arrow Keys** to step through the sorting process manually.
  - Press **Spacebar** to toggle automatic sorting.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bubble-sort-visualization.git
   cd bubble-sort-visualization
   ```

2. Install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python bubble_sort_visualization_pygame.py
   ```

## **How to Use**
- Watch as the algorithm compares and swaps elements step by step.
- Use the interactive controls to explore the sorting process manually or automatically.
